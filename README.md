# fcc-surveyform
This is a Free Code Camp (FCC) related project in the web design module. 

## Project Description
This simple survey form is intended to solicit feedback about freeCodeCamp. My two priorities for this project were as follows:
1. User friendliness. I achieved this with high contrast and a simple layout. 
2. Designing the questions so that the survey results could actually be useful.

## Ideas to Improve
- Make the survey container div look like an iPhone, with skeuomorphic design elements. This would include turning the submit button into the home button, and adding wifi and battery shapes to the upper left of the container. 
- Make all fields except "age" required
