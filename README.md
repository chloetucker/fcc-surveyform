# fcc-surveyform
This is a Free Code Camp (FCC) related project in the web design module. 

## Project Description
### Version 1
This simple survey form is intended to solicit feedback about freeCodeCamp. My two priorities for this project were as follows:
1. User friendliness. I achieved this with high contrast and a simple layout. 
2. Designing the questions so that the survey results could actually be useful.

### Version 2 (current):
This version is a tongue-in-cheek survey intended for owners of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (the phone that had the tendency to explode). I felt that I had completed version 1 quickly, that it didn't have any character, and that I essentially hadn't extracted enough learning from the project. This version achieved my goals, but I spent longer than I would've liked on it.

## Ideas to Improve
- Refactor the margins, padding, and alignment to more clearly use inheritance when appropriate, e.g. make the question text all left aligned.
- Build on the skeumorphism: make the "phone" look three-dimensional, add a camera shape to the upper left corner, make the shapes look like they're part of the phone, make it look like the survey is appearing on a web page (need to recreate what an browser would look like, with address bar, etc)
